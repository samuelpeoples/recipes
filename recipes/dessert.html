        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1 Â¼ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 pint heavy cream</li>
            <li>6 kiwifruit, peeled and sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; draw a 9-inch circle on the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff but not dry. Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until meringue is thick, white, and glossy.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in cornstarch, vanilla extract, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Spoon mixture inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper. Working from the center, spread mixture toward the outside edge and build the edge slightly. This should leave a slight depression in the center.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is dry and sounds hollow when tapped, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Beat heavy cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form; set aside. Remove meringue from the parchment paper and place on a flat serving plate.</li>
            <li>Fill center of meringue with whipped cream and top with kiwi slices.</li>
            <li>Top with fruit and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
